4. Add spring onion bulbs, French beans, cabbage, carrot, spring onion greens and pepper powder, mix and cook for 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
5. Dust the worktop with some flour, place a portion of the dough on it and roll out into a large thin disc. Cut out circles from it using a medium size cookie cutter. 
6. Place a portion of the cooked vegetable mixture in the centre of each circle, bring the edges together and pinch to shape into momos.
